            <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Start by planting easy crops like potatoes or beans in the spring. Rotate your crops each season to maximize profits.</li>
				<li>Prioritize upgrading your tools (e.g., watering can, pickaxe) to make farming and resource gathering more efficient.</li>
				<li>Once you have a stable income, invest in animals. They provide valuable products like eggs and milk.</li>
				<li>Explore the mines for ores and gems. Mining is a great way to gather resources for crafting and upgrading.</li>
				<li>Fishing can be lucrative, especially when selling high-demand fish. Learn the best locations and times for fishing.</li>
				<li>Collect wild plants and forageable items around the town for extra income and crafting materials.</li>
				<li>Talk to villagers and complete quests to build friendships. This can lead to valuable rewards and events.</li>

            <h2>More Tips & Tricks</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Research crop values. For example, strawberries are excellent in spring, and blueberries are great in summer. Plant high-value crops for maximum profit.</li>
				<li>Fertilizers can boost crop quality and growth speed. Use quality fertilizer for better yields, and speed-gro to shorten growth time.</li>
				<li>Save your gold for tool upgrades and barn/coop expansions instead of spending it all on decorations early on.</li>
				<li>Plan your farm layout strategically. Group similar crops together and leave space for paths and buildings to make everything easily accessible.</li>
				<li>Upgrade your fishing rod and use bait. Fish can provide a steady income, especially during seasonal events.</li>
				<li>Start preparing for the next season a few days in advance. For example, clear your farm of leftover crops before the new season begins.</li>
				<li>Bring food and a weapon when mining. Focus on getting down to lower levels quickly for valuable resources but be mindful of health.</li>
